    <h3>Our Story</h3>
    <p>We "met" while both of us were using the dating website <a href="http://www.match.com">match.com</a>. Paul was meeting hundreds of girls while Katie was casually talking to a few people. Something about each other intrigued the opposite, so after a month of emailing and texting we decided to meet. The date was set to meet at <a href="http://tspub.com/">T’s Pub</a> on Comm Ave in Boston, February 25, 2013 (their tag line, ironically, is “The Place to Meet”). We had a drink and talked for hours. Paul kissed Katie goodnight over the <a href="http://www.mbta.com/schedules_and_maps/subway/lines/stations/?stopId=11201">Green Line</a> tracks, and we haven’t been apart since.</p>
    <p>After finding our first furry baby Seamus, we added a brother cat, Coleman, and love our little family.  (For more about the cats, click <%= link_to "here", cats_path %>.)</p>
    <h3>Engagement Story</h3>
    <p>Because we are each other’s best friends, keeping secrets is rarely an option, and because we are planners, surprises are hard to pull off, too. So we did the brunt of wedding planning before we were actually engaged! We even booked the venue two weeks before Paul popped the question. This proved fortuitous however, as Paul was then able to propose a year exactly to our wedding date! So on August 13, 2015 he took Katie to a special dinner at the wedding venue, and snuck the ring to the headwaiter while Katie wasn’t looking. The waiter hid the ring in a large pile of whipped cream over their baked Alaska dessert. Katie kept hitting the box with her fork and wondering what in the world would be in the middle of the ice cream, until Paul pulled it out and clarified by proposing! Now we are going to start an anniversary tradition at <a href="http://cafeescadrille.com/">Café Escadrille</a>, and can’t wait for many more to come!</p>
