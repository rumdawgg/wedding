    <h3>Our Story</h3>
    <p>We met while we were both using the dating website <a href="http://www.match.com">match.com</a>. Paul was meeting hundreds of girls while Katie was casually talking to just a few guys. Something about each other intrigued the opposite, so after a month of emailing and texting we decided to meet. The date was set for February 25, 2013 to meet at T’s Pub on Comm Ave in Boston after Paul got out of his class at BU. (Their tag line, ironically, is “The Place to Meet”). We had a drink and talked for hours. Paul kissed Katie goodnight over the <a href="http://www.mbta.com/schedules_and_maps/subway/lines/stations/?stopId=11201">Green Line</a> tracks and we haven’t been apart since.</p>
    <p>After adopting our first furry baby Seamus in June, we added a brother cat, Coleman that December. We moved to Tewksbury, MA in January 2015 and we love our little family! (For more about the cats, click <%= link_to "here", cats_path %>.)</p>
    <h3>Engagement Story</h3>
    <p>Because we are each other’s best friends, keeping secrets is hard. And because we are planners, surprises are nearly impossible to pull off. We ended up doing the brunt of the wedding planning before we were actually engaged! (Vendors thought we were crazy.) We even booked the venue two weeks before Paul popped the question. This proved fortuitous however, as Paul was then able to propose exactly one year prior to our wedding date! So on August 13th, 2015 he took Katie to a special dinner at Café Escadrille and snuck the ring to the headwaiter while Katie wasn’t looking. The waiter hid the ring (in its box) in a large pile of whipped cream over their baked Alaska dessert. Katie kept hitting the box with her fork and wondering what in the world would be in the middle of the ice cream! Paul then pulled it out, showed her the ring and proposed! It was very silly but will forever be a wonderful memory. Now, we are going to start an anniversary tradition at <a href="http://cafeescadrille.com/">Café Escadrille</a>.</p>
